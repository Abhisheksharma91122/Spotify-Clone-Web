1) Spotify Clone

This repository contains a Spotify Clone web application designed to practice and enhance mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application mimics the core functionality of Spotify, allowing users to play songs, manage playlists, and dynamically add new music folders.

2) Features

- **Play Songs**: Play individual songs with a simple and user-friendly interface.
- **Dynamic Playlist Management**: 
  - Add a new folder to the songs directory.
  - Automatically update the website to reflect the new folder as a playlist.
  - Automatically add the music files in the folder to the song library.

3) Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling for an appealing user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality, including dynamic updates and music playback.

4) How It Works

4.1. **Adding a Folder**:
   - Add a new folder with music files to the designated song directory in the project structure.
   - The web application automatically detects the new folder and updates the playlist section to include it.

4.2. **Song Playback**:
   - Songs can be played directly from the playlists or the main library.

4.3. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - No manual refresh is required; the application detects and integrates new folders and files dynamically.
